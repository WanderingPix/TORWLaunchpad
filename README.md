# ❔ About Us
Launchpad is a mod for Among Us that adds in brand new roles, features, and gamemodes! It is designed so that the roles and features stay somewhat consistent with the original game and don't feel out of place!

## 🌟 Features
**MOST OF THESE ARE FROM THE BASE MOD**
You can read about all of the features on the [wiki](https://launchpad.xtracube.dev/), but here are a couple of them:

- ✅ Gradient Colors
- ✅ Special Voting Modes
- ✅ Feature-Rich Roles
- ✅ New Game Options
- ✅ Exciting Gamemodes

## 🔧 Compatibility
- ✔️ Supports 2025.3.25 (16.0.0) on PC (Android support coming soon™).
- ❗️ Launchpad is **NOT** a host-only mod. Every player needs to install it to enjoy.
- 🔒 Launchpad does **NOT** work on normal Among Us servers. We host our own private game servers instead.
